# 004

004 is a multiplayer vehicle chase game, in which the assailant gains points by destroying property, before being caught by the pursuing opponent. Notable is the algorithm that generates and places unique map sections out of road/city components, also scattering dynamic objects, as you explore new terrain [Swift & UIKit].
